# Refactoring existing website code for accessibility (Challenge 1)

## The task

I was tasked with taking an existing code base and refactoring it to make it more accessible and optimised for search engines, without changing the overall look and feel of the website. As someone new to web development this stretched my understanding of accessibility, but through making some changes and using semantic html the website is now closing to meeting accessibility standards. 

Whilst refactoring the code I began to notice patterns in the css and decided to try to reduce the complexity of the code, which should also improve accessibility. This meant changing some of the elements and classes in the existing html and css code. Through a bit of trial and error the code has been tidied up significantly (in my opinion), however there's still further improvements I'd like to make as I improve my coding knowledge.

## Usage

As the brief included an instruction to not change the look of the current site I have included a screenshot below which was provided by the client. To access my version, navigate to [My refactored Horiseon website ](to be include)

## Installation

To view the code navigate to my version of the website using the link above and right click on any website element and cick inspect or download the source code from [My GitHub repo](https://github.com/DarrenOxley7/challenge-1.git) and open the index.html file in VS Code.
